input files must be named as "input_hist.root"


In the begining the name of the input root files \
must be included in a text file like: \
input1 \
input2 \
etc \
Do not write _hist.root after it. \

Any function will automatially convert the name into \
input_hist.root \



The README function would dump all the function described in this macro
